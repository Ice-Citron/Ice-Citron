## Hi there, I'm Shi Hao! 👋

I’m Shi Hao. Just Shi Hao. I love AI and I think we are getting AGI by December of 2026. My favourite AI combos so far is Claude MCP + OpenAI's O1 Pro. (Skibidi)

I'm quite confident that I can make anything given enough time. And I want to devote my life to AI and Nuclear Fusion research. OwO
